#+TITLE: Spacemacs Cheat Sheet

This is my personal Spacemacs commands cheat sheet, what I use on a regular
basis. This is not meant to be a complete list of all available commands I use
for the different work I have to do (coding in different languages, text writing
and other Org-mode stuff).

This list assumes the usage of =evil-mode= which is a mix of leader based
Vim-like commands and opriginal Emacs-type commands.Most of the commands are Vi
commands.

Note that all the =leader based Vim-like= commands are performed when you are in
=normal= mode.

We use a few abbreviation in the key bindings, they are:

| Abbreviation | Description  |
|--------------+--------------|
| =SPC=        | Spacebar key |
| =M=          | Meta key     |

Note: we do use =zero width spaces= for some of the Org-mode escaping necessary to properly display the cheat sheet.
