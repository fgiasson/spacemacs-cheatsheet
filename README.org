#+TITLE: Spacemacs Cheat Sheet

This is my personal Spacemacs commands cheat sheet, what I use on a regular
basis. This is not meant to be a complete list of all available commands I use
for the different work I have to do (coding in different languages, text writing
and other Org-mode stuff).

This list assumes the usage of =evil-mode= which is a mix of leader based
Vim-like commands and opriginal Emacs-type commands.Most of the commands are Vi
commands.

Note that all the =leader based Vim-like= commands are performed when you are in
=normal= mode.

We use a few abbreviation in the key bindings, they are:

| Abbreviation | Description  |
|--------------+--------------|
| =SPC=        | Spacebar key |
| =M=          | Meta key     |

Note: we do use =zero width spaces= for some of the Org-mode escaping necessary
to properly display the cheat sheet.

* Help

Any time, you can press =SPC ?= to find all the possible key bindings for a
given function. Take the one you prefer. In this cheatsheet, I display the ones
I prefer personally, but some of the functions may have more than 4 or 5
different keybindings!

As a rule of thumb, if this is something I use very often, I often use the Emacs
binding.

|             |                          |

When querying the tag view, you can use '+', '-' and '|' to add, remove or ask
for a choice. "+foo-bar" means "I want notes with 'foo' but not 'bar'".
"foo|bar" means "give me the notes tagged with foo or bar".

Querying tag views takes into account the tags inheritence (based on headers
levels & filetags).

 2. Open =helm-ag-edit= with =C-c C-e=
 3. Go to an occurrence of =foo= and enter =iedit-mode= with =SPC s e=
 4. Change =foo= to =bar=
 5. Save the modifications and leave =helm-ag-edit= with =C-c C-c=
 6. Alternatively, discard all changes and leave =helm-ag-edit= with =C-c C-k=
